## What is The Love Letter?
An all-around tool for stalking ❤️ built primarily on minimal code, portability and a single executable (and the least includes as possible)

## What do I offer?
- Undetectable keylogger
- A smart event-based screenshot
- Windows activity logger (like [procmon](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon))
- **Looting via file upload - faster and less buggier than email**
- UAC bypass - credits to [UACME](https://github.com/hfiref0x/UACME)
- Makes itself comfortable on the target's PC

and many more, I just don't feel like writing it all here. Explore the source code for yourself and see
