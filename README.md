## What is The Love Letter?
An all-around tool for stalking ❤️ built primarily on minimal code, portability and a single executable (and the least includes as possible)

## What do I offer?
- Undetectable keylogger
- A smart event-based screenshot
- Windows activity logger (like [procmon](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon))
- **Looting via file upload - faster and less buggier than email**
- UAC bypass - credits to [UACME](https://github.com/hfiref0x/UACME) using methods 41, 43, 53 and 59
- Makes itself comfortable on the target's PC

and many more, I just don't feel like writing it all here. Explore the source code for yourself and see.

## Why C#? Why not C++?
You must be asking that question, well my answer is quite simple. I first started on this project I already had C++ in mind, even the first commit of this project was in C++ but to my dismay C++ requires vc++ redistributables to be installed I looked further and found out .net 4.6 comes preinstalled on Windows 10 without the need of installing more components (such as, vc++ redistributables). With that in mind I decided to make the entire program in .net.
