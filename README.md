## Setup...
## Prerequisites
- Visual Studio 2019 or later
- Basic knowledge in C#
- At least 3 braincells
## Building
1. First you need a server, you may use any free web-hosting service as long as it has PHP, upload [TellMe.php](Server/TellMe.php) there
2. Change the API endpoint at [Server.cs](Client/Communication/Server.cs) pointing to [TellMe.php](Server/TellMe.php) on your server

</p>

3. Compile on release, not on debug
4. ```!IMPORTANT!``` To prevent peeking (reverse engineering) I suggest you may want to [obfuscate the letter](https://github.com/mkaring/ConfuserEx)
5. Now all you need is to gain senpai's trust and run the program on his laptop, goodluck!
